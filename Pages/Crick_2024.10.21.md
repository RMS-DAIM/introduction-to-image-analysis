# Overview

In this workshop, we will bridge the gap between advanced microscopy data generation and the computational skills required for its analysis. By leveraging open-source tools like [FIJI](https://fiji.sc) and [napari](https://napari.org), participants will learn to automate image analysis, enhancing the precision, efficiency, and reproducibility of their research. This two-day event, led by experienced core facility staff from the Francis Crick Institute and King's College London, offers a practical approach to mastering quantitative analysis and workflow automation, essential for advancing research across multiple domains.

>Applications for this workshop have now closed.

# FAQ

1. **Do I need any prior knowledge of image analysis, FIJI or napari to attend?**

    No, this workshop is aimed at complete beginners, but a basic understanding of image acquisition would be beneficial.

2. **Do I need to have any experience of coding?**

    While some basic knowledge would be helpful, it's not essential and even if you have no knowledge of python, Jupyter notebooks or FIJI scripts/macros, you should still apply.
